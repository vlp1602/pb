<ins>Six-channels sound composition</ins>: residency() {

*This piece was structured to emphasise the acoustic architecture of the spaces. Sequences of call and response patterns highlighted the reverberation of the stone chambers. The 
composition comprises four sections lasting approximately ~10’. 
Sections III and IV were released by [Dióbél Kiadó](https://diobel.bandcamp.com/) as part of [EzmBA v/a](https://diobelkiado.hu/index.php?spr=0&lang=hun).*
