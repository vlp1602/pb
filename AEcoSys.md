# AEco [AEco.STx/AEco.5o/AEco.16o.1i]

Algorithmic System for generative AV Installations ( ) {
  AEco (Ancestral Ecosystem) is an ecosystemic algorithm which has been used at the core on a series of installations. AEco is not based on natural dynamics or genetic algorithms, but instead utilizes ancestral principles and methodologies of intragenerational knowledge exchange to generate emergent behaviours. Its design has been adapted for multiple audio-visual installations, including: 
 @ AEco.STx [visual module] (RCA Hidden, RCA Battersea Hangar, May 2023); 
 @ AEco.16o.1i [live performance for a 13.4 spatial sound system and acoustic piano] (IKLECTIK, Corpora Aliena, November 2021); 
 @ AEco.5o [Audio-Visual installation for 5 speakers and visual module] (St James Hatcham, 1 Sep 2021 - 5 Sep 2021). 
};

//----STx [VISUAL MODULE]------

/* 
Portable visual module with printed guide and engraved acrylic panel depicting the system’s internal dynamics.
This implementation works to decode a message embedded within the ancestry of the ecosystem. The message slowly emerges and evolves depending on the behavioural patterns of the ecosystem.
STx runs on a MacMini and is designed as a portable solution for research on the system. Written in C++
