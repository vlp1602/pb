# I Dropped My Camera Into The Deepest Hole In London
Film + Sculpture: Our Slanted. Deserted. Remains( ){
  hARTslane,  11-13 June 2024.
};  

/*
Film mixing CCTV sewer inspections with footage of central London and computer-generated sewage systems. 
Deep beneath the asphalt in a maze of poorly lit concrete tunnels, muddy waters flow toward darkness. In the city’s digestion system, we encounter the remnants of a life before and through the deepest hole, waste becomes a vessel of truth.
