/*
Film mixing CCTV sewer inspections with footage of central London and computer-generated sewage systems. 
Deep beneath the asphalt in a maze of poorly lit concrete tunnels, muddy waters flow toward darkness. In the city’s digestion system, we encounter the remnants of a life before and through the   deepest hole, waste becomes a vessel of truth.
