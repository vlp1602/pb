 A set of materials belonging to the Hyperspace group was 3D-scanned and sound-recorded. This audio-visual data was arranged into a unified textural corpus and used as the base material for the piece. A visual representation of the corpus was also UV printed on a sheet of metal hanging from the venue’s ceiling. Corpus Align was shown as part of HYPERSPACE’s group final show.
